**SCENARIO-BASED REACT QUESTIONS**

**State & Rendering Scenarios**

1. A component re-renders too many times — how do you find the cause and fix it? ***
2. You have a list of 10,000 items — how do you render it without freezing the UI? (virtualization) ***
3. You have deeply nested components — how do you avoid prop drilling? (Context, custom hooks, state libraries) ***
4. A state update is not reflecting immediately — why does this happen and how do you fix it? ***
5. useEffect is running in an infinite loop — what causes this? ***

**Performance Scenarios**

1. A large form becomes slow — what React optimizations will you apply? ***
2. A slow API response is blocking render — how do you show fallback UI with Suspense or loaders? ***
3. How do you cache expensive calculations in React? (useMemo) ***

**API & Data Handling Scenarios**

1. API fails sometimes — how do you implement retry logic? ***
2. Requirement: show global loader during all API calls — how do you implement this? ***
3. You need to cancel API requests on component unmount — how do you implement it? ***

**Architecture Scenarios**

1. How will you structure a large React project? (feature-based modules, hooks, services, store) **
2. Multiple components need shared logic — how will you reuse it? (custom hooks) ***
3. Multiple components need shared global state — when to use Context vs Redux? ***

**Security & Auth Scenarios**

1. Where do you store JWT tokens securely? (httpOnly cookie vs localStorage) ***
2. How to implement token refresh on 401 errors? ***
3. How to protect routes in React Router? (private routes) ***

**UI/UX Scenarios**

1. How to implement skeleton loader while data loads? ***
2. A dropdown must close when clicking outside — how to implement click outside detection? ***
3. A modal must render above everything — how to implement with portals? ***

**Task**

1. Create a dashboard/table after fetching data from api, should be capable of CRUD operations and search filter. ***
